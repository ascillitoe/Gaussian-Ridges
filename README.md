# Gaussian-Ridges
Codes for dimension reduction using Gaussian Ridge Functions. 

For details, see: 
Seshadri, P., Yuchi, S., Parks, G., (2018) "Dimension Reduction Via Gaussian Ridge Functions".

For running these codes, you will need a working version of MATLAB. You will also need the following libraries:
1. Manopt
2. GPML
